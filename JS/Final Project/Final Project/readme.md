# Final Project: Advanced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Challenge

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Final Project of the course! This project is designed to test your understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a primary focus on JavaScript. This challenge will push you to implement dynamic features, manipulate the DOM, handle events, and create a fully functional, interactive web application.

You will build a responsive task management application that allows users to create, manage, and delete tasks. The app will have features like task filtering, dynamic task updates, local storage, and more. The aim is to give you a real-world experience of JavaScript-based front-end development.



# HTML:

Build a semantic, well-structured layout for the task management app.
Use appropriate tags for the navigation, task input form, task list, and footer.
# CSS:

Apply responsive styling using CSS Grid or Flexbox for the overall layout.
Style form elements, buttons, and dynamic task lists using custom # CSS.
Use media queries to ensure that the app is mobile-friendly and responsive.

# JavaScript: (Main Focus)

Add interactivity using vanilla JavaScript. No external libraries like jQuery or frameworks like React should be used.
Manage DOM manipulation dynamically for tasks.
Use local storage to save the user's tasks across sessions.
Implement event handling for task addition, editing, filtering, and deletion.
Write reusable, clean, and modular JavaScript code.
Features

## Core Features (Required)
- Add Task: Users can add new tasks using an input form.
- Mark Task as Complete: Tasks can be marked as complete, and the UI should reflect the completed state.
- Delete Task: Users can delete individual tasks from the list.
- Filter Tasks: Provide options to filter tasks by "All", "Completed", or "Pending".
- Save to Local Storage: Store tasks in the browser's local storage, so that tasks persist after refreshing the page.
Bonus Features (Optional but Encouraged)
- Edit Task: Allow users to edit task descriptions.
Due Date: Let users add due dates to tasks and show upcoming deadlines.
- Task Prioritization: Allow users to set priorities (low, medium, high) for tasks.
- Dark Mode: Implement a dark/light mode toggle.

Local Storage:

The app will save tasks to the browserâ€™s local storage, allowing them to persist across page refreshes or browser sessions.
